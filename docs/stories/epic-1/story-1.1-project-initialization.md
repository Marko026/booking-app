## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Information

**Tech Stack (from Backend & Frontend Architecture):**

- **Framework:** Next.js 15+ with App Router
- **Language:** TypeScript 5.3+ (strict mode)
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS 3.4+ with shadcn/ui
- **Package Manager:** pnpm (faster, more efficient)
- **Linting:** ESLint with Next.js config + Prettier
- **Git Hooks:** Husky + lint-staged

**Directory Structure (from Frontend Architecture):**

```
booking-app/

├── __tests__/             # Test files
└── public/                # Static assets
```

**Coding Standards (from Frontend Architecture):**

- Use TypeScript strict mode (`"strict": true` in tsconfig.json)
- Never use `any` type
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Follow naming conventions:
  - Components: PascalCase (e.g., `BookingCard`)
  - Files: kebab-case (e.g., `booking-card.tsx`)
  - Functions: camelCase (e.g., `handleSubmit`)
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_GUESTS`)

**ESLint Configuration:**

```json
{
	"extends": ["next/core-web-vitals", "prettier"],
	"rules": {
		"@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": "error",
		"@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": "error"
	}
}
```

**Prettier Configuration:**

```json
{
	"singleQuote": true,
	"semi": false,
	"tabWidth": 2,
	"trailingComma": "es5"
}
```

### Testing

**Test File Location:**

- Unit tests: `__tests__/components/`, `__tests__/lib/`, `__tests__/utils/`
- Integration tests: `__tests__/integration/`
- E2E tests: `__tests__/e2e/` (Playwright, configured in Story 1.6)

**Testing Frameworks:**

- Jest v29.x for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Test setup will be configured in Story 1.6

**Testing Standards:**

- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies
- Target 80% code coverage overall
- Component tests should test behavior, not implementation
