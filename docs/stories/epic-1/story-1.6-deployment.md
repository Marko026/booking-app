## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Information

**CI/CD Strategy (from Backend Architecture - Deployment Strategy):**

**Deployment Flow:**

1. Code pushed to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions runs tests and linting
3. Vercel automatically deploys on success
4. Preview deployments for pull requests
5. Production deployment on merge to main

**GitHub Actions Workflow:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:15
        env:
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
        options: >-
          --health-cmd pg_isready
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: 8

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'pnpm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

      - name: Run linter
        run: pnpm lint

      - name: Run type check
        run: pnpm type-check

      - name: Run tests
        run: pnpm test
        env:
          DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/test
```

**Jest Configuration:**

```javascript
// jest.config.js
const nextJest = require('next/jest')

const createJestConfig = nextJest({
	dir: './',
})

const customJestConfig = {
	setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'],
	testEnvironment: 'jest-environment-jsdom',
	moduleNameMapper: {
		'^@/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/$1',
	},
	collectCoverageFrom: [
		'app/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
		'components/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
		'lib/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
		'!**/*.d.ts',
		'!**/node_modules/**',
	],
	coverageThresholds: {
		global: {
			branches: 80,
			functions: 80,
			lines: 80,
			statements: 80,
		},
	},
}

module.exports = createJestConfig(customJestConfig)
```

**Sentry Configuration (NFR12):**

```typescript
// sentry.client.config.ts
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs'

Sentry.init({
	dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN,
	environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
	tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
	beforeSend(event, hint) {
		// Filter PII
		if (event.user) {
			delete event.user.email
			delete event.user.ip_address
		}
		return event
	},
})
```

**Vercel Configuration:**

```json
// vercel.json
{
	"framework": "nextjs",
	"buildCommand": "pnpm build",
	"devCommand": "pnpm dev",
	"installCommand": "pnpm install",
	"env": {
		"NODE_ENV": "production"
	}
}
```

**Rollback Strategy (from Backend Architecture):**

- Primary Method: Vercel instant rollback to previous deployment
- Trigger Conditions: Error rate spike, critical bugs, performance degradation
- Recovery Time Objective: < 5 minutes (instant rollback via Vercel dashboard)

### Testing

**Test File Location:**

- CI/CD tests: `__tests__/ci/`
- Deployment smoke tests: `__tests__/deployment/`

**Testing Standards:**

- Create smoke tests for critical paths
- Test database connectivity
- Test API endpoints accessibility
- Mock external services in tests
- Run tests in CI before deployment

**Initial Smoke Test:**

```typescript
// __tests__/smoke.test.ts
describe('Smoke Tests', () => {
	it('should pass sanity check', () => {
		expect(true).toBe(true)
	})

	it('should import Prisma client', async () => {
		const { prisma } = await import('@/lib/db')
		expect(prisma).toBeDefined()
	})
})
```
