# Story 2.6: Booking Cancellation

## Status

**Ready for Development**

## Story

**As a** guest,  
**I want** to cancel my booking if my plans change,  
**so that** I can free up the dates and inform the owner.

## Epic

Epic 2: Guest Booking Experience

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Cancel button displayed on booking confirmation page
2. Cancellation confirmation dialog implemented (are you sure?)
3. API endpoint created at PUT /api/bookings/:confirmationCode/cancel to update booking status
4. Booking status updated to 'cancelled' in database
5. Cancelled bookings removed from availability calendar (dates become available again)
6. Cancellation confirmation email sent to guest
7. Cancellation notification email sent to owner/admin
8. Cancellation policy message displayed (if applicable)
9. Prevent cancellation if check-in date is too close (e.g., within 48 hours)
10. Visual indication on confirmation page when booking is cancelled
11. Error handling for already-cancelled bookings
12. Authentication and authorization required for cancellation API (confirmation code + additional verification)
13. Rate limiting implemented for cancellation API (3 attempts per day per IP address)
14. Database transactions implemented for atomic cancellation operations (all-or-nothing)
15. Comprehensive audit logging for all cancellation actions (who, when, what, why)
16. Rollback mechanism for failed cancellations (restore booking status if email fails)
17. Additional verification required for high-value cancellations (amount > threshold)

## Dev Notes

**Security Implementation:**

- Implement JWT or session-based authentication for cancellation API
- Use database transactions (BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK) for atomic operations
- Implement rate limiting using Redis with daily counters per IP
- Use structured logging (Winston) for audit trail with correlation IDs
- Implement email verification for high-value cancellations

**Data Integrity:**

- Use database transactions to ensure atomicity of cancellation operations
- Implement idempotent cancellation (safe to retry)
- Add database constraints to prevent invalid states
- Implement compensation transactions for rollback scenarios

**Business Rules:**

- Define high-value threshold in configuration (e.g., > $500)
- Implement cancellation policy engine
- Add business rule validation before cancellation

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Story 2.6 defines a comprehensive booking cancellation system with good business logic coverage including policy enforcement and notification requirements. The acceptance criteria cover all essential cancellation functionality. However, critical security vulnerabilities around unauthorized access and data integrity issues need immediate attention before implementation.

### Refactoring Performed

No code refactoring performed - story is in draft status.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ (N/A - story definition phase)
- Project Structure: ✓ (Follows established story format)
- Testing Strategy: ✗ (Missing specific test requirements)
- All ACs Met: ✓ (All acceptance criteria are well-defined)

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Analyzed requirements traceability with Given-When-Then patterns
- [x] Identified critical security vulnerabilities (unauthorized cancellation, lack of authentication)
- [x] Assessed business risks (revenue loss through cancellation abuse)
- [x] Evaluated data integrity concerns (missing transaction management)
- [ ] Add authentication/authorization requirements for cancellation API
- [ ] Define rate limiting requirements for cancellation API
- [ ] Specify transaction management for atomic cancellation operations
- [ ] Add audit trail requirements for cancellation actions
- [ ] Define rollback mechanism for failed cancellations
- [ ] Add comprehensive test scenarios for security and business logic

### Security Review

**Critical Security Concerns:**

- No authentication/authorization specified for cancellation API
- Unauthorized cancellation vulnerability - anyone with confirmation code could cancel
- Missing rate limiting could enable cancellation abuse
- No audit trail for cancellation actions
- No prevention of unauthorized cancellations

**Recommendations:**

- Implement proper authentication for cancellation API
- Add authorization checks to prevent unauthorized cancellations
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse (e.g., 3 cancellations per day per IP)
- Create comprehensive audit trail for all cancellation actions
- Add additional verification for high-value cancellations

### Performance Considerations

**Positive Aspects:**

- Simple API endpoint design for good performance
- Direct database updates without complex processing

**Recommendations:**

- Implement database transactions for atomic operations
- Optimize database queries for cancellation operations
- Consider caching for cancellation policy lookups
