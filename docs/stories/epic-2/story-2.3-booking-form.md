# Story 2.3: Booking Request Form

## Status

**Ready for Development**

## Story

**As a** potential guest,  
**I want** to submit my booking request with my contact information,  
**so that** I can reserve the apartment for my selected dates.

## Epic

Epic 2: Guest Booking Experience

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Booking form component created with React Hook Form integration
2. Form fields: firstName, lastName, email, phone, numberOfGuests, special requests/notes
3. Zod validation schema created for all form fields (email format, required fields, guest count limits)
4. Real-time form validation with helpful error messages
5. Number of guests validated against apartment maxGuests capacity
6. Selected dates and total price displayed as read-only summary in form
7. Terms and conditions checkbox (if applicable)
8. Submit button with loading state during submission
9. API endpoint created at POST /api/bookings to create booking
10. Double-booking prevention: API checks availability before creating booking
11. Booking created with 'pending' status by default
12. Unique confirmation code generated for each booking (e.g., 8-character alphanumeric)
13. Guest record created/updated in database
14. Form clears and shows success state after submission
15. Error handling for booking conflicts ("These dates are no longer available")
16. **[CRITICAL]** Transaction uses Serializable isolation level
17. **[CRITICAL]** Booking availability check uses SELECT FOR UPDATE (row-level locking)
18. **[CRITICAL]** Retry logic handles Prisma transaction conflicts (P2034)
19. Rate limiting implemented (5 booking requests per 5 minutes per IP)

## Dependencies

- Story 1.2 (Database Schema)
- Story 2.1 (Availability Calendar)
- Story 2.2 (Pricing Calculation)
- **BLOCKER:** Backend Architecture must be updated with concurrent booking strategy (C2) and rate limiting configuration (C3) before implementation

## Dev Notes

**CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:**

See Backend Architecture document for full concurrent booking implementation with pessimistic locking (SELECT FOR UPDATE) and Serializable isolation level.

See Risk Assessment R1 (Double-Booking) for complete mitigation strategy.

Rate limiting must be configured per NFR6 and Risk Assessment R4.

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Information

**Concurrent Booking Strategy (from Backend Architecture):**

- Use Serializable isolation level for transactions
- Implement SELECT FOR UPDATE for row-level locking
- Handle Prisma transaction conflicts (P2034) with retry logic
- Rate limiting: 5 booking requests per 5 minutes per IP

**Form Validation Schema (Zod):**

```typescript
const bookingFormSchema = z.object({
	firstName: z.string().min(2, 'First name must be at least 2 characters'),
	lastName: z.string().min(2, 'Last name must be at least 2 characters'),
	email: z.string().email('Invalid email address'),
	phone: z.string().min(10, 'Phone number must be at least 10 digits'),
	numberOfGuests: z.number().min(1).max(apartment.maxGuests),
	specialRequests: z.string().optional(),
	termsAccepted: z
		.boolean()
		.refine((val) => val === true, 'You must accept terms'),
})
```

**API Endpoint Structure:**

```typescript
// POST /api/bookings
{
  apartmentId: string;
  startDate: string; // ISO date
  endDate: string;   // ISO date
  numberOfGuests: number;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  specialRequests?: string;
  totalPrice: number;
}

// Response
{
  bookingId: string;
  confirmationCode: string;
  status: 'PENDING';
  message: string;
}
```

### Testing

**Test File Location:**

- Component tests: `__tests__/components/booking/booking-form.test.tsx`
- API tests: `__tests__/api/bookings.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `__tests__/integration/booking-flow.test.ts`

**Testing Standards:**

- Test form validation with valid and invalid inputs
- Test concurrent booking scenarios with multiple requests
- Test rate limiting functionality
- Test transaction conflict handling
- Test error handling and user feedback
- Mock database operations and external dependencies
