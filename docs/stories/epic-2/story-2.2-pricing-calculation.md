# Story 2.2: Dynamic Pricing Calculation

## Status

**Ready for Development**

## Story

**As a** potential guest,  
**I want** to see the total price for my selected dates including any seasonal rates,  
**so that** I understand the exact cost before booking.

## Epic

Epic 2: Guest Booking Experience

## Acceptance Criteria

1. API endpoint created at GET /api/pricing/:apartmentId?start=YYYY-MM-DD&end=YYYY-MM-DD returning price breakdown
2. Pricing calculation logic implemented considering seasonal pricing rules from PricingRule table
3. Base price used when no pricing rules match the date range
4. Price breakdown displayed showing: number of nights, price per night (with any seasonal variations noted), and total price
5. Price updates in real-time as user selects different dates on calendar
6. Currency formatted correctly (EUR/USD/RSD based on configuration)
7. Clear messaging if minimum stay requirements are not met
8. Price calculation accounts for overlapping pricing rules (most specific rule wins)
9. Loading state shown while calculating pricing
10. Error handling for invalid date ranges (end before start, etc.)
11. Price display prominent and easy to understand

## Dependencies

- Story 1.2 (Database Schema - PricingRule model)
- Story 2.1 (Availability Calendar)

## Dev Notes

**NOTE:** This story implements simplified pricing using `basePricePerNight` only. Full seasonal pricing rules will be managed in Epic 4. The architecture supports both, but Epic 2 MVP focuses on base pricing.

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Information

**Pricing Calculation Logic (from PRD):**

- Base price per night from apartment data
- Apply pricing rules in priority order (highest priority first)
- Support seasonal pricing, weekend surcharges, minimum stay requirements
- Calculate total: (base price + rule adjustments) × nights
- Validate against apartment capacity and availability

**API Endpoint Structure:**

```typescript
// POST /api/pricing/calculate
{
  apartmentId: string;
  startDate: string; // ISO date
  endDate: string;   // ISO date
  guestCount: number;
}

// Response
{
  basePricePerNight: number;
  appliedRules: Array<{
    name: string;
    type: 'seasonal' | 'weekend' | 'minimum_stay';
    adjustment: number;
    description: string;
  }>;
  totalNights: number;
  subtotal: number;
  totalPrice: number;
  isValid: boolean;
  errors?: string[];
}
```

**Component Architecture:**

```typescript
// components/booking/pricing-breakdown.tsx
interface PricingBreakdownProps {
	apartmentId: string
	startDate: Date | null
	endDate: Date | null
	guestCount: number
	onPriceChange?: (price: PricingResult) => void
}
```

### Testing

**Test File Location:**

- Service tests: `__tests__/lib/services/pricing-service.test.ts`
- API tests: `__tests__/api/pricing-calculate.test.ts`
- Component tests: `__tests__/components/booking/pricing-breakdown.test.tsx`

**Testing Standards:**

- Test pricing calculation logic with various rule combinations
- Test API endpoint with valid and invalid inputs
- Test component rendering and price updates
- Test error handling and validation
- Mock external dependencies (database queries)
