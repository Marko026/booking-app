# Story 2.4: Email Confirmation System

## Status

**Ready for Development**

## Story

**As a** guest who just booked,  
**I want** to receive an instant email confirmation with my booking details,  
**so that** I have proof of my reservation and know what to expect.

## Epic

Epic 2: Guest Booking Experience

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Email service configured (Resend API or Nodemailer with SMTP)
2. Email template created for booking confirmation (HTML + plain text versions)
3. Confirmation email includes: apartment name, guest name, check-in/check-out dates, number of guests, total price, confirmation code, and owner contact information
4. Email sent immediately after successful booking creation
5. Email sending integrated into booking creation API endpoint with error handling
6. Failed email sends logged but don't block booking creation
7. Retry mechanism for failed email sends (job queue or simple retry logic)
8. Email appears professional with proper formatting and branding
9. Test mode for email sending in development (logs to console or preview service)
10. "From" address configured appropriately (e.g., bookings@yourdomain.com)
11. Reply-to address set to owner's email for guest responses
12. Input sanitization implemented for all email template variables to prevent template injection
13. Email address validation using RFC-compliant regex for all email inputs
14. Rate limiting implemented for email sending API (e.g., 10 emails per minute per IP)
15. Email delivery tracking and retry policy defined (3 retry attempts with exponential backoff: 1min, 5min, 15min)
16. GDPR compliance implemented for email data processing (consent tracking, data retention policy)

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Email template rendering with various booking data
- Input sanitization validation for all template variables
- Email address validation using RFC-compliant regex
- Retry mechanism logic and exponential backoff

### Integration Tests

- Email service integration with booking creation API
- Queue system integration (BullMQ or Vercel Queue)
- Email delivery confirmation tracking
- Rate limiting enforcement testing

### End-to-End Tests

- Complete email flow: booking creation → email sending → delivery confirmation
- Email template rendering across different email clients
- Failed email handling and retry scenarios
- GDPR compliance testing (consent tracking, data retention)

### Security Tests

- Template injection prevention validation
- Email address validation edge cases
- Rate limiting abuse prevention
- Audit logging verification

### Performance Tests

- Email sending performance under load
- Queue processing efficiency
- Retry mechanism performance impact

## Dev Notes

Email sending should be decoupled from booking creation using a queue (BullMQ or Vercel Queue). See Risk Assessment R3 for email failure mitigation strategy.

**Security Requirements:**

- Use DOMPurify or similar library for input sanitization
- Implement email validation using libraries like `email-validator` or `joi` with email schema
- Use Redis or similar for rate limiting implementation
- Implement audit logging for all email operations

**GDPR Compliance:**

- Track email consent in database
- Implement data retention policy (auto-delete email logs after 2 years)
- Provide email unsubscribe functionality
- Document data processing purposes

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Story 2.4 defines a comprehensive email confirmation system with good separation of concerns and proper error handling strategy. The requirements are well-defined with clear acceptance criteria covering all essential aspects of email functionality. However, several security and reliability concerns need to be addressed before implementation.

### Refactoring Performed

No code refactoring performed - story is in draft status.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ (N/A - story definition phase)
- Project Structure: ✓ (Follows established story format)
- Testing Strategy: ✗ (Missing specific test requirements)
- All ACs Met: ✓ (All acceptance criteria are well-defined)

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Analyzed requirements traceability with Given-When-Then patterns
- [x] Identified security concerns (template injection, email validation)
- [x] Assessed reliability gaps (retry policy, delivery tracking)
- [ ] Add specific test requirements for email functionality
- [ ] Define input sanitization requirements for email templates
- [ ] Specify email address validation requirements
- [ ] Document retry policy details (intervals, max attempts)
- [ ] Add email delivery confirmation tracking requirements
- [ ] Consider GDPR compliance requirements for email data

### Security Review

**Critical Security Concerns:**

- Template injection vulnerability risk - no input sanitization specified
- Email address validation not mentioned
- GDPR compliance for email data processing not addressed

**Recommendations:**

- Implement proper input sanitization for all template variables
- Add RFC-compliant email address validation
- Ensure GDPR compliance for email data handling

### Performance Considerations

**Positive Aspects:**

- Asynchronous email sending via queue system
- Email failures don't block booking creation
- Retry mechanism specified

**Recommendations:**

- Define email sending timeout configuration
- Implement email queue monitoring and alerting
