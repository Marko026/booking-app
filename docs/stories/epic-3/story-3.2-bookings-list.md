# Story 3.2: Bookings List & Filtering

## Status

**Ready for Development**

## Story

**As a** property owner,  
**I want** to see all bookings with filtering and search capabilities,  
**so that** I can find specific reservations and manage them efficiently.

## Epic

Epic 3: Admin Booking Management

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. Admin bookings page created at /admin/bookings with paginated table
2. Bookings table displays: confirmation code, guest name, apartment, dates, status, total price, and actions
3. Status badges with color coding (pending=yellow, confirmed=green, cancelled=red)
4. Filter options: status (all/pending/confirmed/cancelled), apartment, date range
5. Search functionality by guest name, email, or confirmation code
6. Sort functionality by date, price, or status
7. API endpoint created at GET /api/admin/bookings with query parameters for filtering
8. Pagination controls (10/25/50 per page options)
9. Row click opens booking detail view
10. Loading states and empty states ("No bookings found")
11. Export button visible (functionality in Epic 5)
12. Mobile-responsive table (card layout on mobile)
13. Bulk selection with checkboxes for multiple bookings
14. Bulk actions: export selected, change status (with confirmation)

### Performance Requirements

15. Table must load within 3 seconds even with 10,000+ bookings
16. Server-side pagination implemented
17. Debounced search with 300ms delay
18. Database indexes on: status, check_in, check_out, guest_name, guest_email, confirmation_code
19. Virtual scrolling for large result sets
20. Query result caching for common filter combinations (5 min TTL)

### Security Requirements

21. Admin authorization required for bookings list access
22. Query parameter validation to prevent SQL injection
23. Rate limiting: 100 requests per minute per admin user
24. Audit logging for bookings list access and filtering
25. Sensitive data masking in exports

### Error Handling

26. Graceful handling of invalid filter combinations
27. User-friendly error messages for failed searches
28. Retry mechanism for failed API calls (max 3 attempts)
29. Timeout handling for slow queries (10 second timeout)

### Accessibility

30. WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for table interactions
31. Keyboard navigation support (arrow keys, tab)
32. Screen reader compatible table structure
33. Accessible bulk selection controls

## QA Results

### Code Quality Assessment

**Story Status: DRAFT - Not Yet Implemented**

This story defines a comprehensive bookings management interface with 12 acceptance criteria covering pagination, filtering, search, sorting, and responsive design. The story is well-structured with clear technical specifications and proper dependency on the admin dashboard.

### Requirements Analysis

**Strengths:**

- Comprehensive filtering and search capabilities
- Clear pagination requirements with flexible page sizes
- Mobile-responsive design considerations
- Status badge color coding for visual clarity
- Export functionality consideration (deferred to Epic 5)
- Proper API endpoint specification with query parameters

**Areas for Enhancement:**

- Missing bulk operations specification (select multiple bookings)
- No advanced filtering options (e.g., by price range, guest type)
- Limited error handling specifications
- No performance requirements for large datasets
- Missing accessibility considerations for table interactions

### Test Strategy Recommendations

**Unit Tests Required:**

- Filtering logic for status, apartment, date range
- Search functionality (name, email, confirmation code)
- Sorting algorithms for date, price, status
- Pagination calculation logic
- Data transformation for table display

**Integration Tests Required:**

- API endpoint `/api/admin/bookings` with all query parameters
- Database query optimization for filtered results
- Authentication middleware integration
- Error handling for invalid filter combinations

**E2E Tests Required:**

- Complete booking list workflow with filtering
- Search functionality across different data types
- Pagination navigation
- Mobile responsive table behavior
- Row click navigation to booking details

### Risk Assessment

**High Risk Areas:**

1. **Performance with Large Datasets**: Filtering/sorting could be slow with thousands of bookings
2. **Search Performance**: Full-text search across multiple fields needs optimization
3. **Memory Usage**: Large result sets could impact client performance

**Medium Risk Areas:**

1. **Complex Filter Combinations**: Multiple active filters could create complex queries
2. **Mobile UX**: Table-to-card conversion on mobile needs careful design

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: N/A (Not implemented)
- Project Structure: N/A (Not implemented)
- Testing Strategy: N/A (Not implemented)
- All ACs Met: N/A (Not implemented)

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Add bulk operations specification (select multiple bookings)
- [ ] Define performance requirements (table load time < 3 seconds)
- [ ] Add advanced filtering options (price range, guest type)
- [ ] Specify error handling for invalid filter combinations
- [ ] Add accessibility requirements for table interactions
- [ ] Define pagination limits for very large datasets
- [ ] Consider adding column sorting persistence
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation support for table

### Security Review

**Recommendations:**

- Ensure booking list API has proper admin authorization
- Implement query parameter validation to prevent injection
- Consider data masking for sensitive guest information
- Add audit logging for booking list access and filtering

### Performance Considerations

**Critical:**

- Table should load within 3 seconds even with large datasets
- Implement efficient database indexing for filter/sort columns
- Consider server-side pagination with cursor-based navigation
- Optimize search queries with proper full-text indexing
- Implement query result caching for common filter combinations
