# Story 3.1: Admin Dashboard Overview

## Status

**Ready for Development**

## Story

**As a** property owner,  
**I want** a dashboard showing today's check-ins/check-outs and recent booking activity,  
**so that** I can quickly see what's happening today and stay on top of my business.

## Epic

Epic 3: Admin Booking Management

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. Admin dashboard page created at /admin/dashboard (protected by BetterAuth)
2. Today's check-ins displayed in a card with guest names, apartment, and time
3. Today's check-outs displayed in a separate card with guest names and apartment
4. Quick stats displayed: total bookings this month, revenue this month, upcoming bookings (next 7 days)
5. Recent bookings list (last 10) with status indicators
6. Quick action buttons: "Create Manual Booking", "View All Bookings", "Manage Pricing"
7. API endpoint created at GET /api/admin/analytics/dashboard returning dashboard data
8. Loading skeletons shown while fetching data
9. Empty states for when no check-ins/check-outs today
10. Responsive layout that works on tablet and mobile
11. Auto-refresh option or manual refresh button

### Performance Requirements

12. Dashboard must load within 2 seconds on standard connection
13. Data caching implemented with 5-minute TTL
14. Optimized database queries with proper indexing
15. Auto-refresh limited to maximum once per minute

### Security Requirements

16. Admin role verification required for dashboard access
17. Rate limiting: 100 requests per minute per admin user
18. Audit logging for dashboard access
19. Data masking for sensitive guest information in logs

### Error Handling

20. Graceful degradation if API fails (show cached data)
21. User-friendly error messages for network issues
22. Retry mechanism for failed data fetches (max 3 attempts)
23. Error boundary to prevent full page crash

### Accessibility

24. WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for dashboard components
25. Keyboard navigation support
26. Screen reader compatible
27. Color contrast ratios meet accessibility standards

### Code Quality Assessment

**Story Status: DRAFT - Not Yet Implemented**

This story defines a comprehensive admin dashboard with 11 acceptance criteria covering dashboard overview, check-ins/check-outs display, quick stats, recent bookings, and responsive design. The story is well-structured with clear dependencies on authentication, admin layout, and booking data.

### Requirements Analysis

**Strengths:**

- Clear user story with specific business value
- Well-defined acceptance criteria with technical specifications
- Proper dependency mapping to foundational stories
- Includes both functional and non-functional requirements (responsive design, loading states)
- API endpoint specification included

**Areas for Enhancement:**

- Missing error handling specifications for API failures
- No mention of caching strategy for dashboard data
- Limited security considerations beyond basic authentication
- No performance requirements specified (response time targets)

### Test Strategy Recommendations

**Unit Tests Required:**

- Dashboard data aggregation logic
- Date filtering for today's check-ins/check-outs
- Revenue calculation functions
- Booking statistics computation

**Integration Tests Required:**

- API endpoint `/api/admin/analytics/dashboard`
- Authentication middleware integration
- Database queries for dashboard metrics
- Error handling scenarios

**E2E Tests Required:**

- Complete dashboard workflow
- Responsive design validation
- Auto-refresh functionality
- Empty state scenarios

### Risk Assessment

**Medium Risk Areas:**

1. **Data Aggregation Performance**: Dashboard queries could be expensive with large datasets
2. **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refresh without proper optimization could impact performance
3. **Security**: Admin-only access requires robust authorization checks

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: N/A (Not implemented)
- Project Structure: N/A (Not implemented)
- Testing Strategy: N/A (Not implemented)
- All ACs Met: N/A (Not implemented)

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Add error handling specifications for API failures
- [ ] Define performance requirements (dashboard load time < 2 seconds)
- [ ] Specify caching strategy for dashboard data
- [ ] Add security considerations for admin data access
- [ ] Define data retention policy for dashboard metrics
- [ ] Consider adding export functionality for dashboard data
- [ ] Add accessibility requirements for dashboard components

### Security Review

**Recommendations:**

- Ensure dashboard API endpoint has proper admin role verification
- Implement rate limiting on dashboard data requests
- Consider data masking for sensitive guest information
- Add audit logging for dashboard access

### Performance Considerations

**Critical:**

- Dashboard should load within 2 seconds
- Implement efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Consider caching for frequently accessed metrics
- Optimize auto-refresh to prevent unnecessary API calls
