4. Price automatically calculated and displayed based on selected dates
5. Option to override calculated price (manual price adjustment field)
6. Status selection (pending/confirmed)
7. Form validation with Zod schema matching guest booking form
8. API endpoint uses existing POST /api/bookings with admin flag or separate admin endpoint

20. Transaction rollback if any step fails
21. Real-time price recalculation on date changes

### Performance Requirements

22. Availability check must complete within 1 second
23. Price calculation must be real-time (< 500ms)
24. Form submission feedback within 2 seconds
25. Guest lookup autocomplete responds within 500ms

### Security Requirements

26. Admin authorization required for manual booking creation
27. Input validation for all form fields
28. Rate limiting: 50 booking creations per hour per admin
29. Audit logging for all manual bookings with admin user info
30. Price override requires proper admin permissions

### Error Handling

31. Clear error messages for double-booking attempts
32. Validation errors displayed inline per field

### Code Quality Assessment

**Story Status: DRAFT - Not Yet Implemented**

This story defines a manual booking creation system with 13 acceptance criteria covering form design, availability checking, price calculation, validation, and email notifications. The story is comprehensive and well-structured with clear technical specifications.

### Requirements Analysis

**Strengths:**

- Comprehensive form design with all necessary fields
- Availability checking to prevent double-booking
- Automatic price calculation with override capability
- Proper validation using Zod schema matching guest form
- Email notification option for guests
- Clear error handling for booking conflicts
- Form UX considerations (clear after submission, create another option)

**Areas for Enhancement:**

- Missing guest lookup functionality for existing guests
- No specification for handling payment information
- Limited error handling for price calculation failures
- No validation for manual price override limits
- Missing accessibility requirements for form interactions

### Test Strategy Recommendations

**Unit Tests Required:**

- Form validation logic using Zod schema
- Availability checking algorithm
- Price calculation with date ranges
- Manual price override validation
- Confirmation code generation
- Email notification logic

**Integration Tests Required:**

- API endpoint integration (POST /api/bookings with admin flag)
- Database transaction handling for booking creation
- Availability check integration with calendar system
- Email service integration
- Error handling for booking conflicts

**E2E Tests Required:**

- Complete manual booking creation workflow
- Form validation error scenarios
- Availability conflict handling
- Price calculation accuracy
- Email notification sending
- Form reset and "create another" functionality

### Risk Assessment

**High Risk Areas:**

1. **Double-Booking Prevention**: Critical business logic that must be bulletproof
2. **Price Calculation Accuracy**: Financial impact if calculations are incorrect
3. **Data Integrity**: Manual bookings must maintain same data quality as guest bookings

**Medium Risk Areas:**

1. **Manual Price Override**: Could lead to pricing inconsistencies
2. **Email Delivery**: Failed notifications could impact guest experience
3. **Form UX**: Complex form could lead to user errors
