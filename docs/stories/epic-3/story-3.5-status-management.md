# Story 3.5: Booking Status Management

## Status

**Ready for Development**

## Story

**As a** property owner,  
**I want** to easily change booking statuses,  
**so that** I can track the booking lifecycle from pending to confirmed or cancelled.

## Epic

Epic 3: Admin Booking Management

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. Status change functionality in booking detail page with clear visual feedback
2. API endpoint created at PUT /api/admin/bookings/:id/status for status updates
3. Status workflow logic: pending → confirmed, any status → cancelled
4. Automatic email notifications when status changes to confirmed
5. Cancelled bookings free up calendar availability immediately
6. Status history tracked in database (status changes with timestamps)
7. Bulk status update option from bookings list (select multiple, change status)
8. Confirmation dialogs for bulk operations
9. Toast notifications for successful status changes
10. Error handling for invalid status transitions
11. Filter persistence after status updates (don't lose filters)

### Status Transition Rules (STRICT)

12. pending → confirmed: ALLOWED
13. pending → cancelled: ALLOWED
14. confirmed → cancelled: ALLOWED
15. confirmed → pending: NOT ALLOWED (must cancel first)
16. cancelled → any status: NOT ALLOWED (immutable once cancelled)
17. Transition validation enforced at API level

### Bulk Operation Requirements

18. Atomic bulk operations (all succeed or all fail)
19. Maximum 100 bookings per bulk operation
20. Transaction rollback on any failure
21. Detailed success/failure report after bulk operation
22. Progress indicator for bulk operations
23. Bulk operations run asynchronously for > 10 bookings

### Calendar Integration

24. Availability updates must be synchronous
25. Calendar changes committed before status change confirmed
26. Rollback mechanism if calendar update fails
27. Real-time calendar refresh after status changes

### Performance Requirements

28. Single status change completes within 1 second
29. Bulk operations handle up to 100 bookings efficiently
30. Email notifications queued asynchronously
31. Calendar updates optimized with batch processing

### Security Requirements

32. Admin authorization required for status changes
33. Elevated permissions for bulk operations
34. Rate limiting: 200 status changes per hour per admin
35. Audit logging for all status changes with reason codes

### Error Handling

36. Invalid transition attempts return clear error messages
37. Bulk operation failures provide detailed error report
38. Calendar sync failures trigger alerts
39. Email notification failures queued for retry

### Audit Requirements

40. Log all status changes with timestamps
41. Track admin user who made changes
42. Record reason for status change (optional field)
43. Audit log retention: 7 years

## Dependencies

## QA Results

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Story Status: DRAFT - Not Yet Implemented**

This story defines a comprehensive booking status management system with 11 acceptance criteria covering status workflows, bulk operations, notifications, and calendar integration. The story is well-structured with clear business logic specifications.

### Requirements Analysis

**Strengths:**

- Clear status workflow definition (pending → confirmed, any → cancelled)
- Bulk status update capabilities
- Automatic email notifications for status changes
- Calendar availability management
- Status history tracking
- Proper confirmation dialogs for bulk operations
- Filter persistence after updates

**Areas for Enhancement:**

- Missing validation for status transition rules
- No specification for handling payment status changes
- Limited error handling for bulk operation failures
- No accessibility requirements for bulk selection
- Missing audit requirements for status changes

### Test Strategy Recommendations

**Unit Tests Required:**

- Status workflow validation logic
- Bulk operation processing
- Email notification triggers
- Calendar availability updates
- Status history generation
- Filter persistence logic

**Integration Tests Required:**

- API endpoint PUT /api/admin/bookings/:id/status
- Database transaction handling for bulk updates
- Email service integration
- Calendar system integration
- Error handling for invalid transitions
- Concurrent status update handling

**E2E Tests Required:**

- Complete status change workflow
- Bulk status update operations
- Email notification delivery
- Calendar availability updates
- Filter persistence after operations
- Error handling for failed operations

### Risk Assessment

**High Risk Areas:**

1. **Business Logic**: Status transitions must follow strict rules
2. **Data Consistency**: Bulk operations must be atomic
3. **Calendar Integration**: Availability updates must be immediate and accurate

**Medium Risk Areas:**

1. **Email Delivery**: Failed notifications could impact guest communication
2. **Performance**: Bulk operations could impact system performance
3. **User Experience**: Complex bulk operations could lead to errors

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: N/A (Not implemented)
- Project Structure: N/A (Not implemented)
- Testing Strategy: N/A (Not implemented)
- All ACs Met: N/A (Not implemented)

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Add validation for status transition rules
- [ ] Specify handling of payment status changes
- [ ] Add error handling for bulk operation failures
- [ ] Add accessibility requirements for bulk selection
- [ ] Define audit requirements for status changes
- [ ] Consider adding status change approval workflow
- [ ] Add rollback capabilities for failed bulk operations
- [ ] Specify handling of guest notification preferences

### Security Review

**Recommendations:**

- Ensure status update API has proper admin authorization
- Validate all status transition requests
- Implement rate limiting on bulk operations
- Add audit logging for all status changes
- Ensure bulk operations are properly authorized

### Performance Considerations

**Critical:**

- Status changes should complete within 1 second
- Bulk operations should handle up to 100 bookings efficiently
- Calendar updates should be immediate
- Email notifications should be queued for reliability
