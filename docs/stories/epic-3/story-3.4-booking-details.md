## Status

**Ready for Development**

## Story

**As a** property owner,  
**I want** to view complete booking details and update information as needed,  
**so that** I can modify reservations and add notes.

## Epic

Epic 3: Admin Booking Management

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. Booking detail page created at /admin/bookings/[id] showing all booking information
2. All booking fields displayed: apartment, guest details, dates, price, status, confirmation code, notes, created date
3. Edit mode toggle allowing inline editing of: dates (with availability check), number of guests, price, notes
4. Status change buttons: "Mark as Confirmed", "Mark as Pending", "Cancel Booking"
5. API endpoint created at PUT /api/admin/bookings/:id to update booking
6. Status change confirmation dialogs for critical actions
7. Booking history/activity log showing changes (who changed what and when)
8. Success notifications for updates
9. Validation prevents invalid updates (e.g., can't reduce guest count below 1)
10. "Send Confirmation Email Again" button
11. "View Guest Profile" link to see all bookings by this guest
12. Delete booking option with strong confirmation (archive vs hard delete)

### Concurrent Update Handling

13. Optimistic locking using version field in database
14. Conflict detection when multiple admins edit same booking
15. User notification of conflicts with option to refresh or override
16. Last-write-wins with conflict warning

### Business Logic Requirements

17. Date changes must re-validate availability
18. Date changes trigger price recalculation (show old vs new price)
19. Minimum stay validation on date changes
20. Price modifications tracked in audit log
21. Status changes follow valid transition rules

### Performance Requirements

22. Booking detail page loads within 2 seconds
23. Inline editing provides immediate feedback
24. Activity log paginated (20 entries per page)
25. Email notifications queued asynchronously

### Security Requirements

26. Admin authorization required for booking updates
27. Input validation on all editable fields
28. Audit logging for all modifications with timestamps
29. Sensitive data masked in activity logs
30. Delete operation requires elevated permissions

### Error Handling

31. Concurrent update conflicts handled gracefully
32. Price calculation errors shown with fallback
33. Email delivery failures queued for retry
34. Validation errors displayed inline

### Audit Trail Requirements

35. Track all field changes with before/after values
36. Log admin user who made changes
37. Timestamp all modifications
38. Audit log immutable (append-only)
39. Retention period: 7 years for compliance

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Story Status: DRAFT - Not Yet Implemented**

This story defines a comprehensive booking detail view and update system with 12 acceptance criteria covering data display, inline editing, status management, history tracking, and email functionality. The story is well-structured with clear technical specifications.

### Requirements Analysis

**Strengths:**

- Comprehensive booking information display
- Inline editing with availability checking
- Clear status change workflow
- Booking history/activity log tracking
- Email notification capabilities
- Guest profile integration
- Proper confirmation dialogs for critical actions

**Areas for Enhancement:**

- Missing validation for date changes (minimum stay requirements)
- No specification for handling booking modifications that affect pricing
- Limited error handling for concurrent updates
- No accessibility requirements for inline editing
- Missing audit trail requirements for compliance

### Test Strategy Recommendations

**Unit Tests Required:**

- Booking data transformation for display
- Inline editing validation logic
- Status change workflow validation
- Activity log generation
- Email notification triggers
- Guest profile lookup logic

**Integration Tests Required:**

- API endpoint PUT /api/admin/bookings/:id
- Database transaction handling for updates
- Availability checking during date changes
- Email service integration
- Concurrent update handling
- Audit log persistence

**E2E Tests Required:**

- Complete booking detail view workflow
- Inline editing functionality
- Status change confirmation flows
- Email notification sending
- Guest profile navigation
- Delete booking workflow

### Risk Assessment

**High Risk Areas:**

1. **Data Consistency**: Concurrent updates could lead to data conflicts
2. **Business Logic**: Date changes must maintain pricing accuracy
3. **Audit Compliance**: Activity logs must be tamper-proof

**Medium Risk Areas:**

1. **User Experience**: Complex inline editing could lead to errors
2. **Email Delivery**: Failed notifications could impact guest communication
3. **Performance**: Large activity logs could impact page load time

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: N/A (Not implemented)
- Project Structure: N/A (Not implemented)
- Testing Strategy: N/A (Not implemented)
- All ACs Met: N/A (Not implemented)

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Add validation for date changes (minimum stay, advance notice)
- [ ] Specify handling of pricing changes due to modifications
- [ ] Add error handling for concurrent updates
- [ ] Add accessibility requirements for inline editing
- [ ] Define audit trail requirements for compliance
- [ ] Consider adding booking modification approval workflow
- [ ] Add bulk update capabilities

### Security Review

**Recommendations:**

- Ensure booking update API has proper admin authorization
- Validate all input data to prevent injection attacks
- Implement optimistic locking for concurrent updates
- Add audit logging for all booking modifications
- Ensure sensitive data is properly masked in activity logs

### Performance Considerations

**Critical:**

- Booking detail page should load within 2 seconds
- Inline editing should provide immediate feedback
- Activity log should be paginated for large datasets
- Email notifications should be queued for reliability
