nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    score: 90
    notes: 'Comprehensive multi-layered security: Zod validation, BetterAuth authentication, rate limiting, SQL injection prevention (Prisma ORM), XSS protection, HTTPS enforcement, security headers, PII protection. Minor: CSRF protection details needed.'

  performance:
    status: PASS
    score: 88
    notes: 'Clear targets defined: availability checks < 500ms, LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1. Image optimization strategy (WebP/AVIF with Next.js Image), database indexing (composite indexes on booking queries), CDN delivery via Vercel. Minor: API response caching intervals not specified.'

  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    score: 82
    notes: 'Error tracking (Sentry), structured error handling (ApiError hierarchy), retry logic (exponential backoff), 99.9% uptime target. Concerns: Circuit breaker pattern mentioned but not implemented. Health check endpoints missing for monitoring.'

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    score: 92
    notes: 'Excellent: Clear coding standards (TypeScript strict mode, ESLint + Prettier), comprehensive documentation (PRD, architecture, UI spec), modular structure (service layer, separation of concerns), type safety (Zod + TypeScript end-to-end).'

testability_assessment:
  controllability:
    score: 90
    notes: 'All inputs can be controlled via API parameters, form data, database seeding. Environment variables for external dependencies. Date/time mockable with Jest fake timers.'

  observability:
    score: 90
    notes: 'Structured logging with correlation IDs, clear API responses with error messages, database inspectable via Prisma Studio, Sentry captures exceptions with context.'

  debuggability:
    score: 85
    notes: 'TypeScript strict mode catches compile-time errors, comprehensive error messages with codes, logging includes stack traces. Minor: Database query logging not explicitly configured.'
