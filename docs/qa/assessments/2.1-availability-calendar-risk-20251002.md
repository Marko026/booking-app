## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

None identified. This is a well-designed UI component story with comprehensive implementation details.

## High Risks

### 1. [PERF-001]: Database Query Performance Under Load

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Availability queries will be frequent
**Impact**: High (3) - Slow calendar loading could severely impact user experience

**Description**: The availability API endpoint queries the database for every calendar view, and with multiple concurrent users browsing apartments, this could create performance bottlenecks. The query doesn't include pagination or caching strategy.

**Affected Components**:

- `app/api/availability/[apartmentId]/route.ts`
- Database booking queries
- Calendar component loading performance

**Mitigation**:

- Implement query result caching (Redis or in-memory)
- Add database query optimization (ensure indexes are used)
- Implement pagination for large date ranges
- Add query performance monitoring
- Consider pre-computing availability data for popular apartments
- Use database connection pooling

**Testing Requirements**:

- Load testing with 100+ concurrent users
- Query performance benchmarks
- Database index usage validation
- Cache hit/miss ratio testing

**Residual Risk**: Low - With proper caching and optimization
**Owner**: dev
**Timeline**: During development (AC2 implementation)

### 2. [DATA-001]: Date Range Query Logic Complexity

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Complex date logic is error-prone
**Impact**: High (3) - Incorrect availability could lead to double bookings

**Description**: The date range query logic for overlapping bookings is complex and could have edge cases around timezone handling, date boundaries, and partial overlaps. Incorrect logic could show available dates that are actually booked.

**Affected Components**:

- Date range calculation in API endpoint
- Calendar date validation logic
- Booking overlap detection

**Mitigation**:

- Implement comprehensive date range testing
- Add timezone handling (UTC storage, local display)
- Create date boundary test cases
- Add booking overlap validation
- Implement date range visualization for debugging
- Add integration tests with real booking data

**Testing Requirements**:

- Unit tests for all date range scenarios
- Integration tests with overlapping bookings
- Timezone conversion testing
- Edge case testing (leap years, month boundaries)

**Residual Risk**: Low - With thorough testing
**Owner**: dev
**Timeline**: During AC2 and AC6 implementation
